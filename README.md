# Texmaker 4.5 Fork for Elementary OS ![build state](https://travis-ci.org/kostrykin/texmaker.svg?branch=elementary)

Project Goals:

  - provide a slim, but functional LaTeX IDE
  - adapt to Elementary's Look & Feel as far as Qt allows
  - both includes the implementation of new features,
  - but also the removal those,
    - which are rather old-fashioned (e.g. SVN)
    - or superfluous for an average user (e.g. text formatting)
